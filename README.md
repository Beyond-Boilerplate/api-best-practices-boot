# API Best Practices with Idempotency, eTags, Caching, and More

This project demonstrates best practices for building robust, production-ready APIs. The API integrates features like idempotency, eTags, caching, pagination, filtering, sorting, and more to optimize performance, scalability, and security.

## Key Features

1. **Idempotency**: Ensures repeated requests with the same idempotency key do not cause duplicate operations. This feature is especially important for APIs that process critical data (e.g., financial transactions) to avoid unintentional side effects.

   [Idempotency Documentation](./src/main/java/com/github/sardul3/io/api_best_practices_boot/idempotency/README.md)

2. **eTags and Caching**: eTags help optimize HTTP responses by minimizing bandwidth usage when resources haven't changed, while caching reduces the load on databases by storing frequently requested data in Redis.

   [eTag and Caching Documentation](./src/main/java/com/github/sardul3/io/api_best_practices_boot/eTags/README.md)

3. **Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting**: Improves performance by limiting large datasets, making APIs more flexible and responsive. This feature is essential for APIs returning large datasets.

4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Standardizes error responses to ensure users can debug issues effectively with meaningful error messages.

5. **Rate Limiting**: Controls the number of API requests allowed within a given time period, reducing the risk of abuse or server overload.

6. **Security Enhancements**: Implements JWT-based authentication and authorization to secure access to the API, ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected resources.

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                        | Description                                  | Methods   |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `/api/v2/transactions`           | Handles transactions with filtering, sorting, and pagination. | `GET`, `POST` |
| `/api/v2/transactions/{id}`      | Get a specific transaction by its ID.        | `GET`     |
| `/api/v2/transactions/{id}`      | Update a transaction.                        | `PUT`, `PATCH` |
| `/api/v2/transactions/{id}`      | Delete a transaction.                        | `DELETE`  |

## Idempotency

Idempotency ensures that repeated requests with the same parameters result in the same operation without causing unintended side effects, especially for operations like financial transactions or resource creation.

### How It Works:

1. A client sends a request with an `Idempotency-Key` header.
2. The server stores the result of the request under the key.
3. If the client sends the same request again with the same key, the server returns the stored result without reprocessing.

### Implementation:

- **IdempotencyKeyFilter**: Ensures that idempotent requests are tracked, avoiding the possibility of duplicate processing.
- **Persistence Layer**: Stores idempotency keys and their associated request responses in Redis.

For more detailed implementation, refer to the [Idempotency Documentation](./src/main/java/com/github/sardul3/io/api_best_practices_boot/idempotency/README.md).

## eTags and Caching

eTags are used to check if the resource has been modified since the last request. Caching is leveraged to store frequently requested data in memory, reducing database load and improving response times.

### eTags Implementation:

- **Shallow Validation**: Validates if the resource's timestamp has changed.
- **Deep Validation**: Validates if the resource's actual content has changed (using a hash).

### Redis Caching:

Caching uses Redis to store the results of API queries. When a resource is requested again, the system first checks the cache before querying the database.

For further details, refer to the [eTags and Caching Documentation](./src/main/java/com/github/sardul3/io/api_best_practices_boot/eTags/README.md).

## Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting

This API supports dynamic filtering, sorting, and pagination to improve performance when returning large datasets.

### Pagination:

By default, the API returns paginated data to ensure that clients do not request too much data at once. You can control the page size and page number using query parameters:

- `?page=0&size=10`: Fetches 10 records starting from page 0.

### Filtering:

Filters are applied dynamically based on query parameters. Example:

- `?amount>300`: Filters transactions where the amount is greater than 300.

### Sorting:

The API supports sorting by multiple fields. Example:

- `?sort=amount,desc`: Sorts transactions by amount in descending order.

For more details, see the [Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting Documentation](./src/main/java/com/github/sardul3/io/api_best_practices_boot/pageFilterSort/README.md).

---

## Security

The API uses JWT for authentication and authorization. Users must include a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header for protected endpoints.

### Example:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" http://localhost:8080/api/v2/transactions
```
