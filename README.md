# API Best Practices with Idempotency

This project demonstrates various best practices for handling API requests, 

1. **idempotency**. Idempotency ensures that repeated requests with the same parameters produce the same result without causing unintended side effects, making APIs more robust and user-friendly.

[Idempotency Documentation](./src/main/java/com/github/sardul3/io/api_best_practices_boot/idempotency/README.md).
2. **eTags and Caching**: eTags help optimize HTTP responses by minimizing bandwidth usage when resources haven't changed, while caching reduces the load on databases by storing frequently requested data in Redis. This section demonstrates how to implement eTags and Redis caching in Spring Boot, how to handle updates, and how to test these optimizations using Postman.

## Aspriration
Here's a table with 50 essential features and priorities to make your API robust, production-ready, and REST-compliant. These features cover various aspects like security, performance, documentation, and resilience.

| No. | Feature | Description & Best Practices |
| --- | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1   | **Idempotency** | Ensures repeated requests with the same idempotency key don't cause duplicate operations. |

| 4   | **Authentication & Authorization** | Secure access control with OAuth2, JWT, or API keys. |
| 5   | **Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting** | Limits large datasets returned to clients and enables query customization. |
| 6   | **Rate Limiting and Throttling** | Controls the number of API requests to prevent abuse and server overload. |
| 7   | **Consistent Error Handling** | Returns standardized error messages with proper HTTP status codes. |
| 8   | **HATEOAS** | Implements hypermedia links in responses for API discoverability. |
| 9   | **Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring** | Captures logs and monitors performance, requests, and errors. |
| 10  | **API Versioning** | Enables changes without breaking existing clients by versioning the API. |
| 11  | **Data Validation and Sanitization** | Validates and sanitizes input data to protect against security vulnerabilities. |
| 12  | **Automatic API Documentation** | Generates API docs using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI. |
| 13  | **Asynchronous Processing & Queuing** | Handles long-running tasks asynchronously via message queues like Kafka. |
| 14  | **Global Exception Handling** | Catches all unhandled exceptions in a consistent way using global handlers. |
| 15  | **Request and Response Compression** | Uses Gzip or Brotli to reduce payload size for faster data transfer. |
| 16  | **Timeouts and Retries** | Sets timeout limits and retries requests in case of transient failures. |
| 17  | **API Gateway and Load Balancing** | Uses an API gateway for routing and balancing traffic across services. |
| 18  | **Content Negotiation** | Provides support for multiple response formats (e.g., JSON, XML). |
| 19  | **Health Checks and Circuit Breakers** | Implements health check endpoints and circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures. |
| 20  | **Database Connection Pooling** | Optimizes database connections through connection pooling (e.g., HikariCP). |
| 21  | **Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control** | Uses DI frameworks like Spring for better maintainability and testability. |
| 22  | **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** | Allows or restricts resource sharing across different domains. |
| 23  | **Security Headers** | Adds security headers like `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and `X-Frame-Options`. |
| 24  | **Data Encryption (HTTPS/TLS)** | Encrypts all API communications with TLS to prevent data interception. |
| 25  | **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Grants access based on roles and permissions within JWT or OAuth tokens. |
| 26  | **Request Validation Schema** | Implements JSON schema validation to ensure incoming data adheres to defined structures. |
| 27  | **Bulk Operations Support** | Provides support for bulk operations (batch inserts, updates) to reduce the number of API calls. |
| 28  | **Audit Logs** | Maintains a record of API operations for auditing and compliance purposes. |
| 29  | **Rate Limiting Alerts and Metrics** | Integrates rate limiting with monitoring tools for alerting and tracking usage patterns. |
| 30  | **Graceful Shutdown** | Ensures in-flight requests are handled properly during API shutdown. |
| 31  | **API Client SDK Generation** | Provides auto-generated SDKs for various programming languages using OpenAPI or Swagger. |
| 32  | **Multi-tenancy Support** | Supports multiple tenants or clients with isolation for data and configuration. |
| 33  | **Transactional Integrity** | Implements proper transaction management to ensure data consistency. |
| 34  | **API Deprecation Policy** | Clearly communicates when versions will be deprecated and provides transition plans. |
| 35  | **WebSockets for Real-Time Communication** | Supports real-time updates with WebSockets for scenarios like live notifications. |
| 36  | **Rate Limiting Exemptions** | Allows certain trusted clients to bypass rate limits (e.g., internal services). |
| 37  | **API Metrics and Analytics** | Tracks usage metrics and performance analytics for monitoring and optimization. |
| 38  | **Background Job Scheduling** | Handles tasks that need to be executed later or at intervals using job schedulers like Quartz. |
| 39  | **Request Correlation IDs** | Adds correlation IDs to requests to enable tracking across multiple microservices. |
| 40  | **Webhook Support** | Allows clients to register webhooks for asynchronous event-driven notifications. |
| 41  | **Internationalization (i18n)** | Supports multiple languages in responses to cater to a global user base. |
| 42  | **Token Expiration and Refresh Mechanism** | Provides a secure and scalable mechanism for handling token expiration and refresh tokens. |
| 43  | **Concurrency Control (Optimistic/Pessimistic Locking)** | Prevents data conflicts in concurrent environments by locking mechanisms. |
| 44  | **Custom Middleware for Preprocessing** | Provides hooks for custom logic to run before request processing (e.g., logging, rate limiting). |
| 45  | **Swagger-UI for Interactive API Testing** | Uses Swagger-UI to allow developers to test API endpoints directly from documentation. |
| 46  | **Event Sourcing** | Implements event-driven architectures where state changes are stored as events (e.g., with CQRS). |
| 47  | **Resource Naming Consistency** | Follows RESTful conventions for resource naming (`/users`, `/orders/{id}`). |
| 48  | **Scalability (Horizontal and Vertical)** | Ensures the API can scale by adding more instances (horizontal) or resources (vertical). |
| 49  | **Caching Headers (Expires, Cache-Control)** | Uses caching headers to inform clients how long they can cache responses. |
| 50  | **Database Indexing** | Optimizes database performance with proper indexing of frequently queried fields. |

These 50 features ensure that your API is not only functional but also secure, scalable, and efficient, adhering to best practices and modern standards.
