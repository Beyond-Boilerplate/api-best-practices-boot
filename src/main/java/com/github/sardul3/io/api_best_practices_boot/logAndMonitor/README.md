# Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring for API

## Overview

Comprehensive logging and monitoring are critical for any production-ready API. It helps developers and system administrators track requests, identify errors, debug issues, and monitor the performance of APIs. This document outlines the necessary steps and best practices for setting up logging and monitoring in a Spring Boot application to ensure your API is traceable, easy to debug, and capable of notifying you when performance issues arise.

## Goals

- **Traceability**: Ensure every request can be traced from start to finish.
- **Debugging**: Provide clear and actionable logs for debugging purposes.
- **Monitoring**: Set up tools to monitor API performance and track metrics like latency, request throughput, and error rates.
- **Alerting**: Implement alerting mechanisms to notify administrators when issues or performance problems occur.

## Prerequisites

- A working Spring Boot API.
- Access to a logging infrastructure like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Grafana Loki.
- Monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or AWS CloudWatch.

## Key Areas for Logging and Monitoring

### 1. **Log Requests and Responses**

To trace every incoming request and the corresponding response, log all requests and responses, including:
- HTTP Method
- URL
- Request body
- Response status code and body (omit sensitive data)
- Request processing time

**Implementation Steps**:
- Use Spring `HandlerInterceptor` or `Filter` to log requests and responses.
- For example:

```java
@Component
public class RequestResponseLoggingInterceptor extends HandlerInterceptorAdapter {
    
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(RequestResponseLoggingInterceptor.class);

    @Override
    public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) throws Exception {
        logger.info("Incoming request: {} {} from {}", request.getMethod(), request.getRequestURI(), request.getRemoteAddr());
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public void afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, Exception ex) throws Exception {
        logger.info("Outgoing response: {} for request {}", response.getStatus(), request.getRequestURI());
    }
}
```

**Best Practices**:
- **Log correlation ID**: Use a correlation ID (UUID) for each request to trace logs across distributed systems.
- **Sanitize logs**: Avoid logging sensitive data like passwords, tokens, and PII.

### 2. **Exception and Error Handling Logging**

Log all exceptions and errors in a structured way for easy analysis. Use Spring Boot’s `@ControllerAdvice` to globally handle exceptions.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Create a global exception handler to log and return standardized error messages.

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(GlobalExceptionHandler.class);

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleException(Exception e, HttpServletRequest request) {
        logger.error("Error occurred during request: {} {} - Error: {}", request.getMethod(), request.getRequestURI(), e.getMessage());
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).body("Internal Server Error");
    }
}
```

**Best Practices**:
- **Log stack traces**: Capture stack traces for all exceptions.
- **Alerting**: Configure alerting to notify admins for critical errors (e.g., using PagerDuty, AWS SNS).

### 3. **Request Metrics Collection**

Collect metrics like request count, latency, error rates, and response size for each API request.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Use Spring Boot’s `Micrometer` library to capture metrics and expose them to monitoring tools like Prometheus.

```java
@Bean
public MeterRegistryCustomizer<MeterRegistry> metricsCommonTags() {
    return registry -> registry.config().commonTags("application", "my-api");
}
```

- Capture request/response timing, error count, and other metrics via a filter or using Micrometer's `@Timed` annotation.

**Best Practices**:
- **Measure response times**: Use timers to measure the time taken to process each request.
- **Capture error rates**: Track how often requests result in different error codes (400, 500, etc.).

### 4. **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**

Integrate with an APM solution (e.g., New Relic, Datadog, or OpenTelemetry) to track deeper performance metrics, trace requests across services, and monitor overall health.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Integrate Spring Boot with your APM provider by adding their respective agents or dependencies.
- Example for New Relic: Add the New Relic agent to your JVM.

**Best Practices**:
- **Trace distributed services**: Ensure that distributed tracing is enabled to track requests across multiple services.
- **Set performance baselines**: Define thresholds for response time, request rate, etc., and monitor deviations.

### 5. **Health Checks**

Expose a `/health` endpoint to monitor the availability of your API and dependencies (database, Redis, etc.).

**Implementation Steps**:
- Use Spring Boot’s `Actuator` to enable health checks.

```yaml
# application.properties
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info
```

**Best Practices**:
- **Include dependencies**: Extend the health check to include external services (e.g., DB, caches, queues).
- **Use HTTP status codes**: Return appropriate HTTP status codes (`200` for healthy, `500` for unhealthy).

### 6. **Structured Logging**

Implement structured logging to make it easier to analyze logs in aggregation tools like Elasticsearch or Loki.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Use libraries like `logback` or `slf4j` to format logs as JSON.

```xml
<configuration>
    <appender name="JSON_FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
        <file>logs/api.log</file>
        <encoder class="net.logstash.logback.encoder.LogstashEncoder" />
    </appender>

    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="JSON_FILE" />
    </root>
</configuration>
```

**Best Practices**:
- **Include metadata**: Include request IDs, user IDs, and service names in the log for better traceability.
- **Use a log aggregator**: Use tools like Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK) or Loki to centralize logs and make searching easier.

### 7. **Log Rotation and Retention**

Log files can grow large over time. Implement log rotation and retention policies to avoid running out of disk space.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Configure `logback.xml` or your logging configuration to rotate logs based on size or time.

```xml
<rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicy">
    <fileNamePattern>logs/api.%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.log</fileNamePattern>
    <maxHistory>30</maxHistory>
</rollingPolicy>
```

**Best Practices**:
- **Log rotation**: Rotate logs daily or after they reach a certain size (e.g., 100MB).
- **Retention policy**: Keep logs for at least 30 days for auditing and compliance.

### 8. **Alerts and Notifications**

Set up alerting mechanisms to notify you when certain metrics cross thresholds (e.g., high response time, error spikes).

**Implementation Steps**:
- Use Prometheus with AlertManager or Grafana for alerting.
- Example Prometheus alert for response time:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: api_alerts
    rules:
    - alert: HighResponseTime
      expr: http_server_requests_seconds_count{status="500"} > 5
      for: 2m
      labels:
        severity: critical
      annotations:
        summary: "High response time for API"
```

**Best Practices**:
- **Set thresholds**: Define meaningful thresholds for alerting on latency, request volume, and error rates.
- **Escalation policies**: Set up escalation paths for critical alerts using tools like PagerDuty, Slack, or SMS notifications.

## Monitoring Tools

### 1. **Prometheus and Grafana**
- **Prometheus** collects and stores metrics.
- **Grafana** provides dashboards to visualize metrics like request rates, latencies, and error rates.

### 2. **Elastic Stack (EFK)**
- **Elasticsearch** for storing logs.
- **Fluentd** for collecting and shipping logs.
- **Kibana** for visualizing logs and search.

### 3. **AWS CloudWatch**
- Monitors logs and metrics, and creates alarms for high-latency requests or server failures.

### 4. **New Relic/Datadog**
- Provides APM, distributed tracing, and detailed performance analytics.
